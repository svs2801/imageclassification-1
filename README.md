# imageclassification-1
A basic project on image classification using the python and the keras dataset-cifar10 

This project uses python libraries like Tensorflow, Numpy and Keras to perform the image classification. The dataset used for this project is CIFAR10.

The model is trained using CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) and can identify the label/type associated with the image fed from the test case.
The training dataset contains 50000 images of size 32 by 32 pixels and the test data contains 10000 images of size 32 by 32 pixels.
